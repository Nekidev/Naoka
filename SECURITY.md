# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Old versions won't be updated with security patches unless there is an actual reason for users to use an outdated version (like lack of platform support for newer versions).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you've found a security vulnerability, send an email with all the details to security at nyeki dot dev. You should expect a followup, the report will be analyzed and be addressed as soon as possible if we think it's an actual security issue. DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE ABOUT IT NOR LET ANYONE ELSE KNOW ABOUT IT.

Thank you.
